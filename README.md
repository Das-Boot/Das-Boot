### I am Zhaoning Li!

- :mortar_board: Currently, I am a research assistant supervised by **Prof. Yixuan Ku** and **Prof. Yanping Liu** in [**Memory and Emotion Laboratory**](https://sysumelab.com) (MELab) at the Department of Psychology, **Sun Yat-Sen University** (SYSU). Before joining this lab, I worked as an NLP engineer in the Department of Biomedical Artificial Intelligence at **Tianpeng Technology Co., Ltd**. I received a B.E. degree in **Information Security** in 2016 and an M.E. degree in **Software Engineering** in 2018, both from SYSU.
- :bulb: I aspire to make contributions to a “virtuous circle”, in which shared insights into AI (especially Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning) as well as neuroscience and cognitive psychology will advance the development of both fields.
