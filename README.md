### I'm Zhaoning!

- ðŸŽ“ **I am a second-year PhD student working with [Prof. Haiyan Wu](https://haiyanwu.wixsite.com/haiyanwu) in [**Affective, Neuroscience and Decision-making Laboratory**](https://andlab-um.com) (**A. N. D Lab**) in the psychology program at the University of Macau (Macao, China).**

  Before that, I was a research assistant supervised by [**Prof. Yixuan Ku**](https://psy.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/851) in [**Memory and Emotion Laboratory**](https://sysumelab.com) (**MELab**) at the Department of Psychology, **Sun Yat-Sen University** (**SYSU**, Guangzhou, China). Before joining this lab, I worked as an NLP engineer in the Department of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence at [**Tianpeng Technology Co., Ltd**](https://www.tp-data.com) (Guangzhou, China). 
  
  I received a B.E. degree in **Information Security** in 2016 and an M.E. degree in **Software Engineering** in 2018, both from **SYSU**.

- :high_brightness: Enlightened by Heinrich Heine's famous quote, 'Thought precedes action, as lighting does thunder', I devoted myself to theoretical research after familiarising myself with empirical research and application. 
  
  Specifically, I aspire to make contributions to a 'virtuous circle' in which shared insights into artificial intelligence and social psychology will advance the development of both fields. 
  
- :bulb: Research interests: Social cognition, social neuroscience, mentalising, artificial social intelligence, natural language processing
