### I'm Zhaoning!

- ðŸŽ“ **I am a first-year PhD student working with [Prof. Haiyan Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haiyan-Wu-5) in [**Artificial Intelligence, Neuroscience and Decision Laboratory**](https://andlab-um.com) (**A. N. D Lab**) in the psychology program at the University of Macau (Macao, China).**

  Before that, I was a research assistant supervised by **Prof. Yixuan Ku** in [**Memory and Emotion Laboratory**](https://sysumelab.com) (**MELab**) at the Department of Psychology, **Sun Yat-Sen University** (**SYSU**, Guangzhou, China). Before joining this lab, I worked as an NLP engineer in the Department of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence at [**Tianpeng Technology Co., Ltd**](https://www.tp-data.com) (Guangzhou, China). 
  
  I received a B.E. degree in **Information Security** in 2016 and an M.E. degree in **Software Engineering** in 2018, both from **SYSU**.

- :high_brightness: Enlightened by Heinrich Heineâ€™s famous quote, ''Thought precedes action, as lighting does thunder'', I devoted myself to theoretical research after familiarizing with empirical research and application. 
  
  Specifically, I aspire to make contributions to a ''virtuous circle'', in which shared insights into artificial intelligence and social psychology will advance the development of both fields. 
  
  Eventually, I will try to build a theory in this area by working my ass off, despite how naive the theory is and what difficulties I will meet. As the founder of modern social psychology, Kurt Lewin said, ''There is nothing more practical than a good theory''.
